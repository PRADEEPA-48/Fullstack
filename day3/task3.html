    <article>
    
     <p>Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity. Rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events are clear signs that urgent action is needed to protect our environment and future.</p>
     <h2>Main Content:</h2>
     <p>Human activities such as burning fossil fuels and cutting down forests are increasing greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere. This traps heat and causes the Earth's temperature to rise.As a result, we are seeing more natural disasters like floods, wildfires, and hurricanes. Ice is melting in the Arctic, sea levels are rising, and many animals are losing their natural habitats.<br><br>Climate change also affects people — damaging homes, reducing crop yields, and impacting health. The poorest communities suffer the most because they have fewer resources to cope.To fight climate change, we need to use clean energy, plant more trees, and reduce waste. Everyone has a role to play — from governments to individuals.By working together, we can protect the planet for future generations.</p>
